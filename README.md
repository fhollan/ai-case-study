## Business Activities  

  

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?  

 

There are three solutions that Verge created to solve Neuro-patient wait-times for healthcare being human trials, machine learning, and in-house drug trials. This is called the ConVerge platform. “We are the first AI-enabled drug discovery company to discover a novel target and develop it into a clinical candidate entirely in-house.” [Click here to view ConVerge platform.]( https://www.vergegenomics.com/approach)  

 

In-house drug trials allows companies to quickly adjust formulas, follow regulatory restrictions more closely, and lower overall cost of trials (including production, overhead, funding, and staffing). A case study done by Chilengi R, Ogetii G, Lang T.(2010) finds that in-house drug trials are the answer to extensive time, increasing costs, and regulatory issues.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  

There is a growing market for helping patients with no cure for neurological progressive diseases. The family is pressed with the degenerative symptoms and progression of lessened health during the later stages. The American Brain Foundation finds an approximately $800 billion annually cost in major neurologic disorders in the United States (including Alzheimer’s and dementia as largest findings). [Click here to view ABF article.](https://www.americanbrainfoundation.org/the-burden-of-brain-disease/) This finding is predicted to grow as the larger generation group of baby-boomers reaches the age of which onset symptoms appear.  


 
According to an article by the European Academy of Neurology 1 in 3 people will be affected by a neurological disorder in their lifetime, finding an increase of death from disorders increased 40% over the past 10 years. [Click here to view EAN article.](https://www.meningitis.org/welcome-to-our-newsroom/supporting-the-intersectoral-global-action-plan) This finding shows the growing need for treatments and the impact of this market is growing.  

This market includes also many famous people that have been effected by degenerative diseases recently. Actors have been identified of Bruce Willis (frontotemporal dementia), Michael J.Fox (Parkinson's disease), and  Christina Applegate (multiple sclerosis) .

## Recommendations  

  

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 

Using 3d printers to create trial drugs (films, oral deconsecrating tablets (ODT), patches) would be a novel idea for this biotechnology company to implement in their in-house trials. Some other companies in this field are utilizing multiple ways of dispersing medications (iv infusions, films, and liquids) due to the vast field of patients and their unique needs. Using technology to print small batches of patient specific medications would be ideal for their target market.  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?  

Quicker absorption of medications, faster dosing adjustments,  and trial noting are all benefits to creating trial drugs by 3D printing.  An interview with Medical Device Network (MDN) and CEO-Susan Lang (XIL Health) discusses her companies new 3D printed drug for seizures clearing market from the FDA stating that the future of 3D printing can solve multiple issues with small batch creating being supply shortage ( being able to locally print medications), limiting waste ( no waste created from 3D printing), personalizing medication to genetics (treats rare diseases), missing doses or swallowing issues (common in children, ill, and elderly patients), and even solve global access issues world-wide ( access to drugs,  religion restrictions on shots, clean water access, and new way to deliver meds for infectious diseases).[Click here to view MDN interview with Susan Lang.](https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/features/3d-printing-in-drug-manufacturing-unlocking-future-possibilities/?cf-view) 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?  

Seeing that the FDA has already cleared a medication created by a 3D printer, this option could help patients that have specific genetic needs( small batch personally modified medication), difficultly remembering to take pills/have trouble swallowing pills (common in elderly patients), or find that access due to high cost/limited resources could be solved by adapting this technology.
