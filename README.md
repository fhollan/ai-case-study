# Verge Genomics Using Technology and Human Samples to Create Better Health Solutions

## Overview and Origin
**Verge Genomics** 

Verge Genomics was created from a greater need, for a better way to develop and create medications for neurological degenerative disorders. According to their LinkedIn profile, Verge Genomics is a next-generation biopharmaceutical start-up using systems biology to accelerate development of life-saving treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. 14 

This process is created through a multi-focused solution base found on their website stating,“Verge integrates multiple technological innovations across biology, chemistry, translational sciences, and engineering to create medicines more efficiently and with an improved probability of success.” 5 This team based approach allows for seamless delivery that streamlines production and uses professionals across different fields to utilize current and up-to-date resources and technology.  
 

 
* When was the company incorporated?
* According to an interview article in BiopharmaDive( 2002) the company launched in 2015. (1) The company CEO Alice Zhang left schooling and created her startup company seeing that there must be a better, faster, and more cost-efficient way to create drugs for patients that can’t wait.  
 
* Who are the founders of the company?  

Alice Zhang- CEO founded her company which was named by Fortune magazine as one of the 40 women under the age of 40 in the health/bioscience category for Verge transforming drug discovery through AI and machine learning with human data to find better drugs, faster. 15 

Later, Zhang joined with others in her pursuit to update and upgrade the profession of drug making capabilities. In 2021 Eli Lilly partnered, Board of Directors: Al Sandrock ( CEO of Voyager Therapetuics) and Chief Financial Officer: John Applegate (Startup of Valo Health) 2. Both partners add a different level of expertise to Verge.  
 
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 

The neuroscience field is seeing a decline in interest and investment due to the high cost of production, outdated research, and technology costs. This is despite the ever-growing population of patients and healthcare cost of neuro diseases.     

According to an article in CellPress (2014) several large pharmaceutical companies have downsized their neuroscience research divisions due to the time and cost of developing drugs in consideration to other therapeutic areas. 

 
 
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?  

According to an artile in Biospace the company, “Founded in 2015 by CEO Alice Zhang, we’ve raised $32 million in Series A financing to build a next-generation biopharmaceutical company focused on accelerating development of life-saving treatments for patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, Parkinson’s Disease, and Alzheimer’s Disease.” (2)  

 
Business partners are Alexion, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, Sheffield Institute for Translation Neuroscience,  

Investors of BlackRock, Threshold, Global Health Innovation, Section 32, Lilly, ALS Investment Fund, iao Capital Partners, Vulcan Capital, PWuXi AppTec, Agent Capital, OS Fund, Y Combinator. 13 
## Business Activities 
 
* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? 

There are three solutions that Verge created to solve Neuro-patients wait-times for healthcare being... human trials, machine learning, and in-house drug trials. This is called the ConVerge platform.   

A case study done by Chilengi R, Ogetii G, Lang T.  (2010) finds that in-house drug trials are the answer to extensive time, increasing costs, and regulatory issues.  

According to an article in Managed HealthCare Executive Alzhemer’s Disease is to reach the top 10 most costly medical conditions in 10 years. 4 

 
The American Brain Foundation finds a approximately $800 billion annually cost in major nerologic disorders in the United States (including Alzheimer’s and dementia as largest findings) 

 
* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 

According to an article by the European Academy of Neurology 1 in 3 people will be affected by an nurological disorder in their lifetime. 10 
 
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 

This company offers human trials (human brain tissue vs. Animal samples or cells).  
 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) 

“ConVerge Platform offers an end-to-end system that integrates technological innovations from discovery to translation to streamline drug development.” (3) 
 
## Landscape 
 
* What field is the company in?  

Pessoa(2023) writes on this topic of Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of disorders characterized by the progressive loss of function and death of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Some of the most common neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). 21

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years? 
Healthcare is moving towards a more patient-centered focus.  Creating larger amounts of data and healthcare networks/teams develops a great focus on the patients with a holistic approach. According to an article in BMC Health Services ( 2014) found that three essential components for paatient centered care is communication ( sharing information, compassions, and patient needs), partnerships (families, patients, care partners, ) and health promotion(case management and efficient use of resources. 8 

 
* What are the other major companies in this field? 
Biogen- is creating four main drug modalities: small molecule therapeutics, protein therapeutics (for example, monoclonal antibodies), antisense oligonucleotide technologies and gene therapy.17 This diverse creation allows for individual pathways for drugs to have the maximum effect in ways that work well for individuals.  

Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma – Focuses on treating the end stages of neurodecentigrating diseases and take on the challenge of difficult to treat cases. For 300 years this company has helped many individuals creating healthier lives though pharmacutical advancements. This teams focuses on individual cases and measures success in patient success.  This company offers a medication in liquid, films, and IV infusions. 20 

Neuralstem Inc.- Neuralstem (NASDAQ: CUR) is a biopharmaceutical company researching and developing novel treatments for nervous system diseases based on our neural stem cell technology.18 This company utilizes it’s diverse executive team with expertise in immuno-oncology, pharmaceutical development, and biotechnology.
